## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
-  According to me, the service-oriented architecture is a broad enterprise that can approach software development and provide a good advantage for business applications, and it contains information about services about business and how they can execute a business properly that you do, and by using it, you can communicate well on different platforms.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-  Standardized Services Contracts – In terms of standardized services contracts They maintained that their service contracts were equal so that they could be implemented properly.
-  Loose Coupling – In terms of loose coupling, the dependencies in service contracts will be minimized, and for the consumers, they can keep them minimized so that their relationship with each other will be good.
-  Abstraction – In terms of abstraction, it can choose what role they want, and it avoids corruption in implementing data.
-  Service Reusability – In terms of Service Reusability, you can use it again, but you must divide its services first so that it is not maximized in its reuse.
-  Autonomy – In terms of autonomy, it contains the logic that if they want to choose what they encapsulate, it also means that they want to achieve the goal.
-  Statelessness – In terms of Statelessness it is stating that what you want the goal in the business by using a logic and improve the services that you created.
-  Discoverability – In terms of discoverability he can be easily discovered every time, and here you can find him communicating what the purpose of meta data in a business service is.
-  Composability – In terms of Composability, it is related to service reusability they have a relationship to deal how to execute the service and to flex it manually.
-  Interoperability – In terms of Interoperability it states that cooperation by exchanging information to the services.

3. Define Microservices.
-  According to me, the microservices is also a type of architecture that has special components and is adopted by a wide range of business enterprises. But they use an individual method to make it expandable, and another microservice has a cloud approach, so they can share every task they perform and update it immediately. In the cloud, they use small components to be more efficient in entering the business.


4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-  Right tool for the job – In these benefits using the right tool is important because if you use the right tool, you can identify what elements that you want to use, and it helps this the database.
-  Precise scaling – In these benefits it states that using individual to generate the result of the entire applications.
-  Independently deployable – To be able to deploy freely to combine code in this method is easy and easy with small amount changes.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-  The similarity between the two is that they are both used in a business, 
-  They are both reusable, and they have components. 
-  The difference between them is that SOA requires the specific business to be executed, and microservices use the cloud to make it easier for them to update their business, but in microservices there are small components so that they can organize the tasks in implementing the business.

6. Define Web Services.
-  Web services is very useful because it can use standardized messaging system, self-contained, dynamic applications that can be described or invoked over the network to create products and many more can be use in other web-based programs.
7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
-  Exposing the Existing Function on the network – Is the managed coded that can be invoked using HTTP using requests to allow expose the functionality of existing code over the network and other network functionality of your program.
-  Interoperability – Can help access the information because it allows various applications, share data, services and vice versa.
-  Standardized Protocol – It can give the business advantage wide range of choices because its haves four different systems to communicate with each other on a network.
-  Low-Cost Communication- In these benefits the web services use SOAP over HTTP protocol, so you can use your existing low-cost internet for implementing web services.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
-  XML-Based – The xml based it is important because it can organize the data by using this format and the user of the Web Services can easily understand and a data representation and transportation and eliminates any networking, operating system, or platform binding.
-  Loosely Coupled – This system implies that the client and server logic are closely tied to one another and if the interface changes this must be updated.
-  Coarse-Grained – It is a service that accesses the right amount of business logic because these object-oriented technologies such as java expose their service directly.
-  Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous – synchronicity knows how execute the short time of the services and Asynchronous retrieve their reports at a later point in time.
-  Support Remote Procedure Calls (RPC’s) - It is important this in the Web services because if you have a problem, you can remote it by using calls and allow the clients to remind it.
-  Support Document Exchange – Supporting document exchange is very important to the Web services because they can exchange a document that contains a data or can be represented it.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
-  Provider – The purpose of provider it can provide a Web Services that you want to use or choose it before you access it.
-  Requestor – The purpose of the requestor is to request access to Web Services before you enter it.
-  Broker - The purpose of broker is connected to UDDI to find the process that you use in web services architecture.
-  Publish – In publish you need to publish your web services by helping you in broker and it can be accessed to all clients in business.
-  Find - The find is to find the clients and the results of the business if already published now.
-  Bind – The bind is to gather the information that the broker collected about the Web services and if this bind the businesses were run successfully.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
-  SOAP – It is for exchanging info. between computers and describes how to encode an HTTP header and XML
-  WDSL – This is for describing web services and how to access them and an integral part of UDDI that facilities businesses and their services on the internet.
-  UDDI – This is for describing, publishing and finding web services and is specification for a distributed registry of web services.
